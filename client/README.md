# Essential Apps (Nothing OS Style)

A concept implementation of "Essential Apps" inspired by the **Nothing OS 3.0** design language. This project reimagines the app creation experience using Nothing's signature monochrome aesthetic, dot-matrix typography, and glyph interface elements.

## 📱 About The Project

This app serves as a futuristic "Creation Lab" where users can generate functional mini-apps simply by typing a prompt. It adheres strictly to the Nothing design philosophy: raw, technical, and stripped back to essentials.

**Current Status:** Frontend Prototype Complete. **Backend Integration Coming Soon...**

## 🎨 Design Language

- **Palette:** Pure Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), and Nothing Red (#FF0000).
- **Typography:** Custom **NDot57** (Dot Matrix) for headers and clean Monospace for data.
- **UI Elements:** 
  - High corner radius (28px) cards.
  - Subtle white borders for depth.
  - Custom "Glyph" style loading animations (LED sequence).
  - Haptic-focused interactions.
